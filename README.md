## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One new thing I came across while building this card, is that in terms of accessibility, it is important to distinguish between **meaningful** and **decorative** images. Screen readers will ignore **decorative** images.  A **decorative** image does not add to the functionality or the content of a web page.  Using an empty *alt* attribute will set an image as **decorative**.

### Continued development

- Do more small projects like this one to practice flexbox and grid. 
- Keep reading up on Accessibility

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/accessibility/index.php) - This helped me design this card for accessibility. Still reading up on it and will keep updating if need be. 
- [W3Docs](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-add-both-a-background-image-and-css3-gradient-to-the-same-element.html) - This helped me figure out how to do the image overlay with background colour and icon.
